Create a sample structural workforce plan for WCT Holdings Berhad, a Malaysian construction, property development, and investment company. The goal is to use AI to reduce headcount through natural attrition (not layoffs) while increasing productivity.

The plan should:
1. Include an executive summary showing the intent to reduce headcount by ~10% over 18 months through automation and AI adoption in admin-heavy areas (e.g., Finance, Property Management, HR).
2. State clear strategic goals for productivity, AI adoption, and service level retention.
3. Provide a workforce snapshot, including estimated headcount (\~1,400), functions (Engineering, Property Dev, Property Mgmt, Corporate), and past attrition trend (~3.7%).
4. Show AI adoption by department, impacted roles, and estimated roles that will be phased out through attrition.
5. Lay out a roadmap for attrition-based headcount reduction, aligned with historical attrition rates, backfill decisions, and department-level planning.
6. Include KPI improvements pre- and post-AI adoption (e.g., invoices processed per FTE, lease applications handled, SLA compliance).
7. Provide a sample attrition monitoring table, comparing actual vs. planned attrition with backfill info.
8. List risks and mitigation measures (e.g., service disruption, morale, knowledge loss).
9. Show a redeployment strategy for reskilling 30 people into roles like prompt engineering, digital project coordination, and ESG reporting.
10. End with a summary dashboard layout — suggested visual elements like headcount trend lines, KPI graphs, role breakdowns, and cost avoidance vs. AI investment.

Use WCT’s real-world context as of 2024–2025, including its declining headcount trend, focus on construction and property, and strategic direction to improve margins without layoffs.
